# Model-Drone-Step-Response
In this project, we are modeling the step response (flying from 0 to 1 m autonomously) of the Bitcraze Crazyflie Drone Systems.

This is my current research project with Dr. Uri Rogers and two other electrical engineering major, Hope Storro and John Plimpton, at EWU. We are working on modeling a step response-flying from 0 to 1 m autonomously-of the Bitcraze Crazy Drone Systems. In this project, we will study the non-linear theory behind drone system, do measurements, then improve our model. For example, one aspect of the research is to model the voltage drop in the battery better to account for the loading effect during the flight.  

Our goal is to complete the model and publish in June 2023, and our Python code and other resources can be view here. Stay tuned!
